# Unity_FPS_Parkour_Controller
**[NOTICE]** I'll describe the project in more detail in a while, thanks.

A lightweight first-person parkour shooter controller, similar to Cyberpunk Ghostrunner.

**Unity FPS Parkour Controller** sounds great, with many exciting features including sprinting, wall climbing, sliding, wall jumping, grappling, and hook shutting.

The controller is written in C# and is a project based on the Unity engine. It aims to provide a smooth, intuitive control scheme that allows players to experience a FPS parkour-style feel in the game.

With the controller, players can perform various actions such as fast sprinting and sliding, as well as more advanced moves like grappling and hook shutting. These features allow players to showcase their skills and creativity in the game, while also increasing the game's difficulty and challenge.

Additionally, the controller supports customizable settings, allowing players to adjust the controller to their preferences and play style. This means that players can optimize the game according to their needs in order to make it more in line with their expectations.

**Unity FPS Parkour Controller** is a powerful and exciting project that offers many amazing features, allowing players to experience an unparalleled feeling in the game.

The basic controls are: **WASD** to control the character's movement direction, **left Shift** to control the character's sprinting, hold **left Ctrl** during sprinting to slide, and crouch to walk after speed is reduced. The **Q** key can be used to fire the grappling hook, which will attach to a surface based on an algorithm. Holding the **space** bar on a wall allows wall walking, and quickly pressing the **space** bar enables wall jumping. The yellow attachment points on the wall can be used for grappling. **Left-click** to shoot, **right-click** to aim, and **R** to reload (this part uses simple ray detection, with damage decreasing with distance).
